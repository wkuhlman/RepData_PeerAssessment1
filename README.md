## Reproducible Research
## Course Project 1

This repo contains files associated with the Coursera Reproducible Research Course Project 1.

Here's what's what:
- PA1_template.Rmd: R markdown file with the code and text. It's the original template, updated with my solutions.
- PA1_template.md: md file generated from PA1_template.Rmd by knitr
- PA1_template.html: this is the html output of PA1_template.Rmd generated using knitr
- PA1_template_files/figure-html : this directory contains the images for the html file
- activity.zip: this is a local cached copy of the activity data. The r code will automatically download and repalce this. I kept it the original there as a reference, in case the online version is unavailable.
- instructions_fig: file from the original branch. I kept it for reference.
